**Pomodoro Application** is a minimalist and modern web application created using .NET Blazor Web Assembly. Its purpose is to help you focus on tasks and effectively manage your time using the simple and effective Pomodoro technique.

## 🍅 What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. The name "Pomodoro" is derived from the Italian word for "tomato," and it was inspired by a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato that Cirillo used while studying. The technique involves breaking work into short time intervals, called "pomodoros," typically lasting 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After completing 4 pomodoros, you can take a longer break, such as 15-30 minutes. The Pomodoro Technique helps maintain a high level of focus, prevents information overload, and increases productivity.

## 🚀 How Does the Plain Pomodoro Application Work?

- **Start, Pause, and Reset Sessions**: Start a Pomodoro session, pause it when needed, and then reset the timer to the initial value. Simple and intuitive control.
